# LuLab Backend - Multi-stage Docker Build
# ==========================================
# This Dockerfile uses multi-stage build to optimize image size
# Stage 1: Build environment with all dependencies
# Stage 2: Production environment with only runtime dependencies

# ==========================================
# Build Stage
# ==========================================
FROM node:20-alpine AS build

# Enable Corepack for modern package manager support (pnpm/yarn)
# This allows using pnpm as the package manager in the container
RUN corepack enable

# Set working directory for the build process
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package manager files first for better layer caching
# This allows Docker to cache the dependency installation layer
# when only source code changes
COPY package*.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./

# Install all dependencies (including dev dependencies)
# --no-frozen-lockfile allows minor lockfile updates if needed
RUN pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile

# Copy source code after dependencies are installed
COPY . .

# Generate Prisma client, build application, and prune dev dependencies
# This multi-command RUN reduces layer count and image size
